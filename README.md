# M13 Venture Capital Data Project

This project explores early-stage startup funding patterns using mock venture capital data.

## Objective
To demonstrate how SQL and Python can be used to extract actionable insights for venture capital firms like M13, including:

- Which sectors receive the most Seed funding
- How investors distribute funding across rounds and sectors
- Funding trends across sector-stage combinations

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib)
- SQLite (SQL queries executed in-memory)
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Use
1. Open `Theo_Berger_M13_Data_Project.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Make sure `mock_startup_funding_data.csv` is in the same directory.
3. Run the notebook to view queries, analysis, and charts.
